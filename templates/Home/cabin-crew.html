            A cabin crew is one of the most demanding jobs in the aviation industry. The cabin crew, which comprises an air hostess (female) and a flight attendant, is accountable for the enjoyment, health, and protection of the passengers aboard the
            plane (male).
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            According to the rules, no member of the aircrew is allowed to fly more than 3 days a month. This encourages safe job satisfaction as well as an excellent pay structure. After several decades of employment as cabin crew, they can progress
            to head attendants and earn a higher salary.
